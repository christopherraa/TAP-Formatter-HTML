Reported & patched by Michael Hendricks (sponsored by Grant Street Group)
   * If tests are aggregated in multiple phases (per http://xrl.us/bedfih),
     TAP::Harness calls prepare() once for each phase.  Emptying the
     sessions array on each call to prepare() discards all but the last
     phase of test aggregation.  That caused the HTML output to show only
     the results from the final phase.  By emptying the sessions array only
     during initialization, all phases are accumulated and formatted correctly.

Reports from Nadim Khemir:
   * integrate into build scripts (eg: M::B)
   * possible to open the test file and show the test itself?
   * why the need to stop using Test::Harness?


Script still running bug
   * when you navigate away from page
   * only on big test outputs
   * jquery cleanup?

Sometimes test details don't collapse properly!
   * doesn't happen in FireFox 3?
   * related to the scrollTo?
   * could hide & show the tr after the slideToggle?

sort by cols
   * time!
   * test file
   * percent

support file output
   * prove --html=output.html
   * allow output to STDOUT
   * write an App::Prove plugin

wrap unknown test output's in <pre>

expand all tests
expand failed tests

collapse current test (from halway down big tests, maybe a mouseover file or something)

Give the test suite a title...

More tests!
 * parse the generated output
 * check the view given to the TT view
