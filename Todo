wrap unknown test output's in <pre>

expand all tests
expand failed tests

sort by ... cols


Fix bug: % passed on test file != % ok, should add up to # at bottom but doesn't!

Script still running bug
   * when you navigate away from page
   * jquery cleanup?

Reduce space:
   * set titles on page load or mouseover (by looking up name, follow href id)


See if this fixes the non-collapsing problem:
   * hide & show the tr after the slideToggle
   * seems to be related to the scrollTo?

support file output
   * prove --html=output.html
   * allow output to STDOUT
   * write an App::Prove plugin

Give the test suite a title...

More tests!
 * parse the generated output
 * check the view given to the TT view
